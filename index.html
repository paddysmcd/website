    <h5>
        <p style="font-size: 18px;"> I woke up at 8:00 am this morning. I get dressed and brush my teeth. I then go
            downstairs. I sit on the couch and think for a minute, what would we be doing if quarintine didn't
            happen. Everyone would be at work. I would be in Toronto, Canada still on tour. My siblings would be in
            college. I think, "At least I get to
            sit on the couch all day!" After I eat breakfast, I look at some audition material for a self tape that I
            have to record today. I tape it. Then I practice "For Forever" for a duet that I'm doing with my friend.
            Then I take a tap lesson with Christina Carmanuchi. To be honest, quarintine has really made everyone
            improve. I've lots of oppritunities from it. I've taken LOTS of lessons, I created a web series, I've
            got to spend more time with my family, and much more. But, I really miss tour. I was playing Gavroche in
            Les Miserables on the Broadway National Tour. After the tap lesson, I make myself a salad. I was
            starving. It was a pretty chill day. It was also a RAINY day which sucked. I always fell weired on rainy
            days. For the rest of the day I just chilled out. I practiced playing the ukelue and played with my cute
            dogs. Then my mom cooked some REALLY GOOD chicken for dinner. At the end of the night it had stopped
            raining so we went outside just because. We brought clover out to play without a leash. Then I called my
            Granny to catch up. Then for the rest of the night I just watched T.V. Then I got tired and went to bed.
